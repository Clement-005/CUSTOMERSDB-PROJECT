Over the weekend I built a customer database in MYSQL and connected it to my python to send an automated email message to a random customer in the database.
These are the exact steps I used;
I  manually inserted customer records using MYSQL
I connected Python to the Customer database
I queried a random customer: Because it was a synthetic dataset, I input my own details into the database and sent the message to my email and it was successful
Finally I sent an automated Valentine’s Day message and asked the customer to pick up a gift at our mart.

Tech stack:
Jupiter notebook
MySQL
